finding country groups based on chicken diet with PCA
We used csv data from FAO to find country groups. We cross compared the clustering results from hierarchical clustering, K-means with PCA. We found K-means method to be better suited based on consistency with PCA. We identified a top 5 countries list that could be targeted for chicken exporting. We used methods, code fragments from Epimed and others (links indicated in notebok). Any comments welcome. Thanks.
